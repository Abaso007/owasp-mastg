## Overview

This test checks for references to Content Provider access in WebViews which is enabled by default and can be disabled using the `setAllowContentAccess` method in the `WebSettings` class. If improperly configured, this can introduce security risks such as unauthorized file access and data exfiltration.

The JavaScript code would have access to any content provider on the device, **including those declared by the app as not exported** and **others that are exported by other apps** and may or may not be following the recommended [best practices](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-tips#content-providers).

Refer to [Android WebView Local File Access Settings](../../../Document/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#webview-content-provider-access) for more information on the `setAllowContentAccess` method, the specific files that can be accessed and the conditions under which they can be accessed.

The `setAllowContentAccess` method being set to `true` is not a security issue by itself, but it can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to escalate the impact of an attack. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly set it to `false` if the app does not need to access content providers.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Suppose a banking app uses a WebView to display parts of its UI. The WebView doesn't use the `setAllowContentAccess` method at all and therefore it is set to `true`. The WebView has JavaScript enabled and due to another bug, an attacker is able to inject a JavaScript payload (for instance, via an XSS flaw on a remote help page). That payload then issues requests using `content://` URIs to read locally stored files (which might include cached user credentials or transaction data). Even if the content provider is nonâ€‘exported, because the malicious code is running in the same process and same origin as the trusted code, it can access resources that normally wouldn't be accessible from an external source. Finally, since the WebView also has `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` set to `true`, the malicious JavaScript can exfiltrate the data to the attacker's server.

TO BE CONFIRMED!!!!

The provider must also be declared with `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` in the manifest. This is necessary because the provider is not exported, and the app must have the necessary permissions to access the content.

## Steps

1. Use a tool like semgrep to search for references to:
      - the `WebView` class.
      - the `WebSettings` class.
      - the `setJavaScriptEnabled` method.
      - the `setAllowContentAccess` method from the `WebSettings` class.
      - the `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method from the `WebSettings` class.
2. Obtain all content providers declared in the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.
3. Check if the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` attribute is set for each content provider.  TO BE CONFIRMED!!!!

## Observation

The output should contain a list of WebView instances where the abovementioned methods are used.

## Evaluation

The test fails if:

- The `setJavaScriptEnabled` method is explicitly set to `true`.
- The `setAllowContentAccess` method is explicitly set to `true` or not used at all (inheriting the default value, `true`).
- The `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method is explicitly set to `true`.

The test passes if:

- The `setJavaScriptEnabled` method is explicitly set to `false` or not used at all (inheriting the default value, `false`).
- The `setAllowContentAccess` method is explicitly set to `false`.
- The `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method is explicitly set to `false` or not used at all (inheriting the default value, `false`).

Note that we do not even consider `minSdkVersion` since `setAllowContentAccess` defaults to `true` regardless of the Android version and `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` defaults to `false` since API level 16 (Android 4.1 from 2012).
