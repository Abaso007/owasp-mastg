## Overview

To test for the use of encryption algorithms with insufficient strength in iOS apps, we need to focus on methods from cryptographic frameworks and libraries that are used to perform encryption and decryption operations.

- **CommonCrypto**: The [`CCCrypt`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/CCCrypt.3cc.html) function is used for **symmetric algorithms** and specifies the algorithm in its second parameter `alg`. This includes:
    - `kCCAlgorithmAES128`
    - `kCCAlgorithmDES`
    - `kCCAlgorithm3DES`
    - `kCCAlgorithmCAST`
    - `kCCAlgorithmRC4`
    - `kCCAlgorithmRC2`

- **CryptoKit**: This library does not support encryption algorithms with insufficient strength. It supports the following **symmetric algorithms**:
    - `AES.GCM`
    - `ChaChaPoly`

Note: the **Security** framework only supports asymmetric algorithms and is therefore out of scope for this test (see [note about symmetric keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/generating_new_cryptographic_keys#2863931)).

## Steps

1. Run a static analysis tool such as @MASTG-TOOL-0073 on the app binary, or use a dynamic analysis tool like @MASTG-TOOL-0039, and look for uses of the cryptographic functions that perform encryption and decryption operations.

## Observation

The output should contain the disassembled code of the functions using the relevant cryptographic functions.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if you can find the use of encryption algorithms within the source code with insufficient strength. For example:

- DES
- 3DES
- RC2
- RC4

**Stay up-to-date**: This is a non-exhaustive list of deprecated, risky and broken algorithms. Make sure to check the latest standards and recommendations from organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) or any other relevant authority in your region.

Some algorithms may not be considered to have insufficient strength, but may have **inappropriate configurations** that should be avoided. Such as using a seed or IV not generated by Cryptographically secure PRNGs (CSPRNG) or not being considered quantum-safe. For example, an AES 128-bit key size is considered insufficient considering quantum computing attacks. When building an app that uses data that will be stored for a considerable long time. Make sure that you follow NIST recommendations on how to ["Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards"](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8547/ipd).

**Context Considerations**:

To reduce false positives, make sure you understand the context in which the algorithm is being used before reporting the associated code as insecure. Ensure that it is being used in a security-relevant context to protect sensitive data.
