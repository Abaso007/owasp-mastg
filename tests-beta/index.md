??? info "About the MASTG Tests"

    The MASTG "Atomic Tests" are a new addition to the MAS project. They are a collection of small, individual tests that can be used to assess the security and privacy of a mobile application. Each test is designed to be simple and focused on a single issue. The goal is to make it easier for developers and security professionals to identify and fix issues in their mobile applications.

    Tests are organized into categories based on the [OWASP MASVS](../../MASVS/index.md) and have a weakness assigned from the [OWASP MASWE](../../MASWE/index.md).

    Each test includes:

    - **Overview**: A brief description of the test.
    - **Steps**: A set of steps to follow to identify the weakness in a mobile application.
    - **Observation**: A description of the results of running the test against an application.
    - **Evaluation**: Specific instructions for evaluating the results of the test.

    Each test comes with a collection of demos that demonstrate the weakness in a sample application. These demos are written in markdown and are located in the [Demos](../../MASTG/demos/index.md) section of the MASTG.


??? tip "Filtering Tests"
    
    You can use the filter options above the table to filter tests by:
    
    - **Status**: Show deprecated tests only
    - **Platform**: Filter for Android or iOS tests only
    - **Profile**: Filter for tests with specific compliance profiles (L1, L2, R, P)
    
    You can combine multiple filters to narrow down your search. For example, you can display only L2 Android tests or deprecated iOS tests. Use the "Clear All Filters" button to reset all filters.
