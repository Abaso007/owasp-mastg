[cdxgen](https://cyclonedx.github.io/cdxgen/) can generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for most applications and container images with a single command. It supports SwiftPM for iOS and Maven for Android. Also the creation of an SBOM out of an APK or AAB for Android is possible.

The generated SBOM can then be submitted to @MASTG-TOOL-0117 for analysis.
