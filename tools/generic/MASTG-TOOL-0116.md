[Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies.

Limitations for SCA tools are, that they will usually fail to scan an IPA or APK, due to 2 main reasons:

- **Transformed format**: The libraries are no longer in their original format but are part of the app binaries compiled code format.
- **Lack of metadata**: Information such as the library version or name is stripped or altered when building the mobile app.

Therefore usually the files generated by dependency managers are scanned, that list the dependencies used in an app.
